# The age calculating App with React

This project is to demonstrate the use of React-Hook-Form library [React-Hook-Form](https://react-hook-form.com/). The app allows users to calculate their age by entering their birth date.

# Project demonstrates:-

1. The use of rhf for form validation.
2. CSS from scratch.
3. Use of svg images.
4. Use of touched field method.
5. Use of Date object.
6. Use of custom font(.ttf) in CSS

If an input field has been touched and then the user clicks away, the error is displayed as "This field is required", but if an input is invalid "This is not a valid day, month or
year"(respective value is displayed).

I will further work on more challenging projects in the future, as we all have to begin somewhere.

Thanks ✌️.
